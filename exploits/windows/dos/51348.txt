# [ About App ]

Microsoft Windows is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the software fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users. Arbitrary code execution may be possible, but this has not been confirmed.

This issue affects Microsoft Windows 11 Pro.

Note: Further analysis reveals that this is not a vulnerability; this BID is now retired.


# [ POC ]

# 1.Run the python script, it will create a new file "PoC.txt"
# 2.Run Command Prompt
# 3.Copy the content of the file "PoC.txt"
# 4.Paste the content of dos.txt into the lin cmd.exe
# 5.Crashed ;)

#!/usr/bin/env python
