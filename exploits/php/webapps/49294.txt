Explanation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ContactForm7 version 5.3.1 and below doesn't properly sanitize 
uploaded filenames to prevent Arbitrary File Upload that can lead
to full server takeover in the worst-case scenario.

This happens in the wpcf7_antiscript_file_name function, that fails
to sanitize the provided filename if it ends with any Unicode special
character ranging from U+0000 (null) to U+001F (us).

The function matches both the file name and the file extension against
an exclusion regex. Appending any unicode special character to the 
file extension results in a complete bypass of this verification (as
the regex doesn't match) leading to the Unrestricted File Upload.

Exploit
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Change the file extension of the file you want to upload (e.g: 
"shell.php") to its equivalent with the special character ending (in
this case "shell.php" (appended U+0000))

2. Upload the file using ContactForm7 file upload feature in the 
target website.

3. Go to <target.com>/wp-content/uploads/wpcf7_uploads/shell.php
Note the special character at the end
Note that the file upload location may vary as it is configurable.

4. Now you have uploaded your file!
