Description

The plugin was affected by an IDOR issue, allowing students to see other student answers and grades

Proof of Concept

- Add 2 users with Student role for the scenario .
- Create A course With a quiz ( I picked True or Flase question for my quiz)
- Set Enrol on Free ( for the ease of scenario )
- Enrol into the Course with Student B and submit your answer to the Course .

The plugin will give a token like :
https://soft-dream.myliftersite.com/quiz/%d8%ac%d9%85%d8%b9-quiz/?attempt_key=wYK
To Check your answer was true or false.

Now Login as a Student A and Enroll in the Course. You can just use
the URL https://soft-dream.myliftersite.com/quiz/%d8%ac%d9%85%d8%b9-quiz/?attempt_key=wYK
and reach the Student B answer.

Fixed in version 4.21.2âœ“
